Description: automatically configures olsrd for recognized meshes
 This package adds a 'dispatcher' script to NetworkManager to make it
 recognize pre-configured wifi networks as mesh networks.  When the user
 chooses a recognized adhoc wifi network, this script kicks in and starts up
 olsrd with the proper settings.
